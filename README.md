# ncaa_d1_baseball_stats
An end to end data pipeline that scrapes, stores, transforms and visualizes stats from all NCAA D1 Baseball Games. This project was created to demonstrate concepts learned in the 2024 Data Engineering Zoomcamp hosted by the Data Talks Club as well as a fun personal project for me to build a database and frontend that I wish had previously existed.
